# 👋 Hi, I'm Noah

I'm an apprentice electrician who's always had a passion for computers, and I'm diving headfirst into learning everything I can about home labs, self-hosting, and IT.

### ⚡ My Interests:
- 🔌 Home networking & VLAN setups
- 🐳 Docker containers & Portainer
- 📊 Monitoring with Grafana & Prometheus
- 🔒 DNS filtering & ad-blocking with Pi-hole
- 🧠 Learning core concepts like DNS, firewalls, and port routing
- 🤖 Automating my homelab (and breaking stuff along the way)

### 🛠️ Current Projects:
- Raspberry Pi-powered homelab
- Self-hosted dashboard with Homarr
- Isolated VLAN network for testing
- GitHub + Notion to track learning

### 🚀 Always Learning:
I’m currently diving deeper into:
- Networking fundamentals (VLANs, routing, DNS)
- Container orchestration
- Git & version control
- Building a clean homelab portfolio
